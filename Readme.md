# ACES: Automatic Compartments for Embedded Systems


This is was joint research effort between Purdue's [HexHive](http://hexhive.github.io/) and [DCSL](https://engineering.purdue.edu/dcsl/) research groups.  It is presented at [USENIX Security 2018](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity18/presentation/clements)

Both have many more open sourced software:
*  [HexHive Software](https://github.com/HexHive)
*  [DCSL Software](https://github.com/purdue-dcsl)


It has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 other versions of linux may work.


## Dependencies
Install following on Ubuntu 16.04
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential make texinfo bison flex cmake ninja-build ncurses-dev llvm-dev clang binutils-dev python-networkx python-matplotlib python-pygraphviz python-serial texlive-full python-pip
```

```bash
python -m pip install pydotplus
```

##  Setup
To setup the project for the first time clone repo then run.

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/hwiwonl/ACES.git && cd ACES
cd compiler
ci_scripts/init_project.sh
ci_scripts/ci-build.sh
```
This will setup the directory structure, build a arm-none-eabi-ld with plug-in support (builds all gcc)
and build the ACES compiler.  Which is an extension of LLVM.

The resulting directory structure will be as follows.

```
REPO_ROOT
  |-> compiler (Source for ACES compiler)
    |-> llvm  (Src for llvm, this is symlinked in to llvm-release_40 below)
    |-> ci_scripts (ci_scripts)
    |-> hexbox-rt (Runtime src for this project)
    |-> tools  (tools frequently used with this project)
  |-> llvm (created by init script)
    |->llvm-release_40
    |->clang-release_40
    |->hexbox-rt-lib (where the hexbox-rt lib gets built to)
    |->build  (Cmake Build dir for llvm)
    |->bins (LLVM build outputs)
  |-> gcc (created by init script)
    |->gcc-arm-none-eabi-6-...  (GCC Source dir)
    |->bins (location of arm-none-eabi-gcc tool chain and dirs)
  |->test_apps
```


## Building an Application

All test applications require the STM32469I-EVAL board from STM, with the exception of Pinlock which runs on
the STM32F4-Discovery board. Make sure arm-none-eabi-gdb-py is in your path, if not it was build with gcc and can be 
found in <REPO_ROOT>/gcc/bins/bin

You will need to perform the following steps to build the code

1. Build hexbox-rt

```
cd compiler/hexbox-rt
make all
```

2. Build record binaries
3. Run in record mode
4. Build final binaries

Steps 2 - 4 vary based on the board and commands are given below.
### Pinlock

Set HEXBOX_ROOT in <REPO_ROOT>test_apps/pinlock/Decode/SW4STM32/STM32F4-DISCO/Makefile to REPO_ROOT
#### Build record binaries

```
cd test_apps/pinlock/Decode/SW4STM32/STM32F4-DISCO
{REPO_ROOT}/compiler/tools/build_record.sh
```

#### Run Binaries in record mode and build final binaries.

This requires that openocd be running and connected to the board.  You will also need to run the driver application which sends a series of valid and invalid pins to the board.

Connect 3.3V Serial port to Discovery Board RX PA2, TX PA3.  Where TX and RX are from the computers perspective.

Run Stimulus Script
```
python <REPO_ROOT>/test_apps/pinlock/pyterm/pinlock_stimulus.py
```

In separate terminal run record binary to get white-list, and build final binary
```
cd test_apps/pinlock/Decode/SW4STM32/STM32F4-DISCO
APPNAME=PinLock {REPO_ROOT}/compiler/tools/build_final.sh record run
```

### STM32469I-Eval board applications

#### Create Makefile and build application

cd to appropriate SW4STM32 directory under STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.14.0/Projects/STM32469I_EVAL/Applications

```
cd STM32469I_EVAL
python {REPO_ROOT}/compiler/tools/built_tools/CubeMX2Makefile.py . <path to repo root> <Name (one of [FatFs-uSD, TCP-Echo, LCD-uSD, Animation])>
{REPO_ROOT}/compiler/tools/build_record.sh
```

#### Run Binaries in record mode and build final binaries

This will run the record binaries on the board to generate the white-lists then build the final binaries with enforce mode enabled.  It requires that openocd be running and connected to the board.
```
cd test_apps/pinlock/Decode/SW4STM32/STM32F4-DISCO
APP_NAME=<one of [FatFs-uSD, TCP-Echo, LCD-uSD, Animation]> {REPO_ROOT}/compiler/tools/build_final.sh record run
```


For TCP Echo,

Need to connect an ethernet cable to the EVAL board and set computers IP address to 192.168.0.11/24

Run 
```
<REPO_ROOT>/compiler/tools/tcp_connect.py
```
